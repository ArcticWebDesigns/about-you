# About Turner

1. My name is Turner

2. My favorite hobbies include making music and producing music for other people when I can, exploring new places,
  taking my daughter, for wagon walks around the block or reading stories with her, and obviously contributing to Open Source Software projects
  
3. My least favorite candy is Candy Corn, because it is utter trash.

4. Someday I hope to be able to have a coding school to help empower people to reinvent themselves.

5. Maybe not a joke, but it's a quote from the office 
 - "You're going to have pancakes and you're going to love it!" - Michael Scott
